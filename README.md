# Google Geolocation Application
This project will simplify the work of inputing LAT and LONG coordinates to the Google Maps by ultilizing Javascript and PHP Object Oriented to parse and reverse geolcation from the coordinates of an input file and MySQL Database.

## How this project works?
  1. The file input.csv contains the LAT and LONG coordinates, which will be used to upload to a web server. Then, those coordinates will be parsed and displayed to the Google Maps. The coordinates will be store in a MySQL Database to retrieve actual address from Latitude and Longitude coordinate.
